**_UPDATE 12/7/2019: With the release of reason-react 0.7.0, you no longer need to worry about transforming objects to be used in a reason-react component. Just add the types and the props you are passing to the component and use them. In this article, itâ€™s as easy as:_**

```javascript
type data = {
  name: string,
  age: int,
  profession: string,
};

[@react.component]
let make = (~data) => {
   // use `data` as record (i.e. data.name, data.age, etc.)
}
```

**_Nothing more to do!_**

I was playing around with ReasonReact recently and I was trying to figure out how to handle data coming from JS into Reason. I had heard of using `[@bs.deriving abstract]` which takes a JS object and transforms it into a Reason object. In a way this worked. However, the implementation did not seem clean because after conversion I would need to use a series of getters in order to retrieve the values from the object. Let me give you an example to clear up any confusion.

In my JavaScript file I have my basic React setup.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import App from "../lib/es6_global/src/App";

const data = {
  name: "Adam Recvlohe",
  age: 31,
  profession: "developer",
};

ReactDOM.render(<App data={data} />, document.querySelector("#root"));
```

The `App` in this instance is a ReasonReact component that is being wrapped for JS. However, part of the ReasonReact componentâ€™s implementation is to accept a JavaScript object which describes moi.

One way to convert this inside of Reason is to use`[@bs.deriving abstract]` to convert the JS object into a Reason object. Here is how you would do that:

```javascript
/* App.re */

[@bs.deriving abstract]
type data = {
  name: string,
  age: int,
  profession: string,
};

/* Imagine component and make functions here */

type jsProps = {data};

let default =
  ReasonReact.wrapReasonForJs(~component, jsProps =>
    make(~data=jsProps##data, [||])
  );
```

However, this can lead to some weirdness in your component:

```javascript
/* App.re */

let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent("App");

let make = (~data, _children) => {
  ...component,
  render: _self => {
    let name = data->nameGet;
    let age = data->ageGet;
    let profession = data->professionGet;
    <div>
      {
        {j|Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is $name. I am $age years old. I am a $profession.|j}
        |> ReasonReact.string
      }
    </div>;
  },
};
```

The `[@bs.derving abstract]` directive creates an object with the respective accessors to the values with the syntactic sugar of using the new fast pipe (->) operator.

This seemed okay to me but I wanted better. So I asked around the [reasonml.chat](https://reasonml.chat/t/convert-js-object-to-reason-record-in-reasonreact/1106/2) forum to see what other magic I had at my disposal. User [IwanKaramazow](https://reasonml.chat/u/IwanKaramazow) directed me to another helpful directive known as `[@bs.deriving jsConverter]`. This will convert a JS object to a Reason record, which has a bit more syntactic sugar because it will allow me to use destructuring. It looks a little like this:

```javascript
/* App.re */

[@bs.deriving jsConverter]
type data = {
  name: string,
  age: int,
  profession: string,
};

/* Imagine component and make functions here */

type jsProps = {data};

let default =
  ReasonReact.wrapReasonForJs(~component, jsProps =>
    make(~data=dataFromJs(jsProps##data), [||])
  );
```

You will notice I need to wrap the `data` object in a function that is created from the directive: `dataFromJs(jsProps##data)`. This function is dependent on what I call my type. If my type was not `data` but instead `profile`, the function name would then be called `profileFromJs`. After converting the data into a record I can now more succinctly handle the data inside of my component:

```javascript
let make = (~data, _children) => {
  ...component,
  render: _self => {
    let {name, age, profession} = data;
    <div>
      {
        {j|Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is $name. I am $age years old. I am a $profession.|j}
        |> ReasonReact.string
      }
    </div>;
  },
};
```

As you can see I am using destructuring instead of an assignment with an accessor to work with the values I need.

Itâ€™s not always apparent what things are and are not possible because of the varying APIâ€™s at your disposal when working with Reason. You have Reason, BuckleScript, and lastly Ocaml APIâ€™s. Thankfully there is a helpful Reason community who has your back. So check out the [forum](https://reasonml.chat/) or leave me a note here if you have any questions yourself. Otherwise, keep on hacking y'all!
