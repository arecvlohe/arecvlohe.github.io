I didn't attend AISES' (American Indian Science and Engineering Society) National Conference in person this year, although I did sit on a panel virtually, and may not attend again in the future. It's certainly where I'd like to be but having attended the past 2 years I noticed AISES has a pretty strong relationship with entities that I might not have expected: Chevron, United Stated Intelligence and the NSA, Exxon Mobil, and Wells Fargo among others. I pause and wonder what our ancestors might think of us when we invite to the table multi-national corporations that contribute to war, environmental destruction, and the decay of sovereign governments all over the world. Being there is quite surreal in this regard.

It's not just that these entities are bad, which of course they are, but that they also harm our own Native communities. I feel as though the oil conglomerates would seize the opportunity to "show how much they care about Native technologists and scientists" as a way to take focus away from their treatment of Native climate protestors.

Let's do a run-through of these different entities and how they've harmed Native peoples:

- Exxon
  - [DAPL Investments](https://wallstreetwatchdogs.com/2021/04/05/exxon-sues-energy-transfer/)
  - [Alaskan Oil Spills](https://www.ran.org/the-understory/extreme_energy_injustice/)
  - [Ex-employee Heads Enbridge Development](https://gizmodo.com/amazons-former-security-chief-is-now-guarding-the-line-1847724615)
- Wells Fargo
  - [Enbridge and DAPL pipelines](https://www.sierraclub.org/compass/2017/12/wells-fargo-has-choice-make-keystone-xl-tar-sands-double-down-or-divest)
- Chevron
  - [Tar Sands](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chevron-divestiture-canada-idUSKBN17F1S7)
- US Government
  - [Regime change in Bolivia](https://fpif.org/ending-regime-change-in-bolivia-and-the-world/)

This is just what I could find with a simple search. There is probably much more out there and certainly more to include from a historical perspective. Don't get me wrong, I would love to spend time at AISES National Conference and talk face-to-face with other Native technologists and scientists. But knowing what I know now, I can't in good conscious contribute my time and energy to a conference that so enthusiastically accepts support from some the largest entities harming our relatives to the north and south. If it takes these entities' donations in order for the conference to exist, in my opinion, I'd rather it not. We can do so much better for ourselves, our peoples, and our ancestors. It's time we start.
