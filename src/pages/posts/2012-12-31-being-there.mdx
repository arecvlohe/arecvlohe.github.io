I have realized

as I have grown up

that what I appreciated most

is now being acknowledged, so here is a toast

to what means the most.

To my family who was just there

to hear my thoughts and listen to my prayers.

To my friends who were just there

to laugh with and show they cared.

To those who were there on the court, field, and in the classroom

who I never got to know but respected my platform.

To those I only seen for a moment there in time

who helped me to see the world differently, unlike mine.

To those there who have gone on before me

whose influences are strong and presence unearthly.

To those I only know through others

affecting my life in ways unknown.

I have realized

as I have grown up

that what I appreciated most

is now being acknowledged.

So here is a toast

to what means the most:

BEING THERE.
