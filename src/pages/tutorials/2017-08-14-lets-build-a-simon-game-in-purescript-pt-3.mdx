To summarize, in the last [post](/tutorials/2017-08-14-lets-build-a-simon-game-in-purescript-pt-2) you learned how to: create HTML markup using the smolder library, render markup to the DOM, and a whole bunch of operators (`<$>, <#>, $, =<<, <@>`) 🙀.

In this post you will learn how to use [Pux](http://purescript-pux.org/), the Elm-inspired front end UI library for PureScript.

### Detour 👷

I had a bit of an issue with my `bower_components` loading correctly and getting the correct versions. If you experience the same, what I propose are two things. Copy pasta (🍝) the following to your `bower.json`:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
  "purescript-prelude": "^3.1.0",
  "purescript-console": "^3.0.0",
  "purescript-pux": "^10.0.0",
  "purescript-random": "^3.0.0"
},
```

Afterwards run the following commands:

```bash
bower prune
rm -rf bower_components/ && rm -rf output/
bower cache clean
bower install
```

Hopefully this gets you back on track if you run into any issues.

### Getting Started with Pux 🏒

You are going to reorganize your current application in order for it to work with the Pux architecture. To start, pull in the Pux library using `bower`.

```bash
bower install --save purescript-pux
```

As I said previously, Pux is an Elm-inspired library, in this case meaning it follows [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) 🌳. The Elm Architecture is quite simple. It is composed of a `Model`, `View`, and an `Update`. The `Model` is the state of your application. For example, is the sidebar hidden or visible. The `View` function is the markup that renders to the browser and that changes based on the new state of the `Model`. The `Update` function takes any user input, also known as a`Msg`, and the `Model`, and creates a new model. When the `Model` changes the `View` re-renders. If you know React, this pattern may seem familiar to you as well.

> One key difference between Elm and Pux is that Elm has a runtime. This runtime shows its head whenever you create a `Cmd msg`. Pux `effects` are run through the JS runtime, no extra runtime needed.

Pux works very much in the same way with a few slight changes. The `Model` is referred to as `State`. The `Update` function is referred to as `foldp`. The `View` remains the `view`. The `Hello, world!` of UI tutorials is the counter. That is where you will start in order to first get familiar with the architecture. Let's import the appropriate libraries to get started.

```haskell
module Main where

import Pux (CoreEffects, start)
import Pux.Renderer.React (renderToDOM)
```

Next you will gut the `main` function and replace it with the Pux architecture.

### Main 💻

```haskell
main :: ∀ fx. Eff (CoreEffects fx) Unit
main = do
  app <- start
    { initialState: 0
    , view
    , foldp
    , inputs: []
    }

    renderToDOM "#app" app.markup app.input
```

The `main` function now has a new signature. The `CoreEffects` are `CHANNEL` and `EXCEPTION` and any added effects are included as an argument to `CoreEffects` as `fx`. For example, in the future you will add `RANDOM` and `CONSOLE` as `fx` that add to the `CoreEffects`. The `initialState` is, you guessed it, the initial state of the application. The `view` is the `view` function, `foldp` is the `foldp` function, and `inputs` are any `CHANNELS` you want your application to listen for and subscribe to, such as mouse movements.

There are a few more things going on here that is mostly boilerplate. What I think is important to point out is that Pux uses [signals](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-signal/9.0.0) under the hood 🚦. This is a form of functional reactive programming that Elm has since abandoned. However, I think it's good to have an idea of what's happening at the lower levels.

Create two new files inside of the `App` folder, one called `Events.purs` and the other called `Update.purs`. Inside of the `Events.purs` file you will put all of the events that occur in the DOM, like button clicks. The `Update.purs` file will be the logic of your application in the form of a `foldp` function. First, create the two events you will track, `Increment` and `Decrement` in your `Events.purs` file.

```haskell
module App.Events
  ( Event(..)
  ) where

data Event = Increment | Decrement
```

The `data` keyword is what is called a `union type` in Elm. In PureScript this is know as a [tagged union](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Types.md#tagged-unions). You export a `tagged union` using `Event(..)`. Now that you have the events, let's declare a `foldp` function that handles these events.

### Foldp 🗂

```haskell
module App.Update
  ( State
  , AppEffects
  , foldp
  ) where

import Prelude

import Pux (EffModel)
import Control.Monad.Aff.Console (log)
import Control.Monad.Eff.Console (CONSOLE)
import Data.Maybe (Maybe(..))

-- LOCAL

import App.Events (Event(..))

type State = Int

type AppEffects = (console :: CONSOLE)

foldp :: Event -> State -> EffModel State Event AppEffects
foldp Increment state =
  { state: state + 1
  , effects:
    [ log (show $ state + 1) *> pure Nothing
    ]
  }

foldp Decrement state =
  { state: state - 1
  , effects:
    [ log (show $ state - 1) *> pure Nothing
    ]
  }
```

A few new things here. A `type` in PureScript is the same as a `type alias` in Elm. Here I declare the `State` type as an `Int` and also the `AppEffects`. You may think the `foldp` function is being declared multiple times. What is actually happening is you are creating a different function to match the different events that are passed to it. This is one of the great features of functional programming languages and PureScript offers a wide range of [pattern matching](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Pattern-Matching.md) goodies.

For each change in the `State` you also log out the new state to the console. Inside of `effects`, an array of `Maybe Events` is the expected return type. Here you are logging out to the console but not returning any `Event`, so you are instead returning a `Nothing`. The `*>` operator is the [apply](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/3.1.0/docs/Control.Applicative#v:%28*%3E%29) function. In this context, it is saying, do the thing on the left, but return what is to the right. The `show` function is a helper that transforms the `Int` into a string so that it can be logged. This use of `show` is common as you will see in other tutorials.

> Friendly Tip: All effects in Pux are asynchronous and therefore you are using the async version of `log` which is in the `Control.Monad.Aff.Console` module.

With the `folp` and events defined let's work on the new `view` function. The `view` function will take `State` and return an `Html Event`. In the `view` you will add the buttons for `Increment` and `Decrement` as well as a `div` to display the current `State`.

### View 🎑

```haskell
module App.View
  ( view
  ) where

import Prelude hiding (div)

import Pux.DOM.Events (onClick)
import Pux.DOM.HTML (HTML)
import Text.Smolder.HTML (div, button)
import Text.Smolder.Markup (text, (#!))

-- LOCAL

import App.Update (State)
import App.Events (Event(..))

view :: State -> HTML Event
view state =
  div do
    button #! onClick (const Increment) $ text "Increment"
    div $ text "Count " <> show $ state
    button #! onClick (const Decrement) $ text "Decrement"
```

The smolder library provides the `#!` operator to attach event listeners to HTML elements. Because `onClick` passes an event object you don't need in your `Increment` constructor, you use the [const](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/3.1.0/docs/Data.Function#v:const) function which ends up passing `Increment` and nothing else.

To get this all working you will need just one more thing to put into the body of the `index.html`, before `/app.js` and after `id="app"`.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.4.1/react.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.4.1/react-dom.min.js"></script>
```

Pux depends on React and some of its functionality, all of which you can get through a CDN. All together now!

```haskell
module Main where

import Prelude

import Control.Monad.Eff (Eff)
import Pux (CoreEffects, start)
import Pux.Renderer.React (renderToDOM)

-- LOCAL

import App.View (view)
import App.Update (foldp, AppEffects)

main :: Eff (CoreEffects AppEffects) Unit
main = do
  app <- start
    { initialState: 0
    , view
    , foldp
    , inputs: []
    }
  renderToDOM "#app" app.markup app.input
```

If you run `pulp server` you should see two buttons and a count. In the console you should also see the state logged.

### Summary ✅

In this post you learned:

- How to setup the Pux architecture
- How Pux is similar to Elm (`View` and `View`, `Signals`)
- How PureScript is different from Elm (`type` vs `type alias`, `data` vs `type`)
- How to attach an event handler to an element using smolder
- How to update state and add effects to `foldp`
- How to write a `tagged union` and `type` constructor
- Pattern matching in PureScript
- What `*>` is
- How to import/export `tagged unions` and `types`

What you didn't learn:

- What a `signal` is
- What `CoreEffects` does
- What is `app <- start`
- What are `inputs` really
- How my `bower_components` got so f-ed up

The things that I did not cover would be good for independent study. I recommend looking at the book [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) as well as the [PureScript Documentation](https://github.com/purescript/documentation) to get some background if you haven't done so already. Also, check out all the library document on [Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/). If you have any questions check out the [Slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/purescript/purescript) channels. Until next time, keep hacking!
