I am still on the PureScript bend after writing about how you can port over your Elm code into PureScript with Pux. I really enjoyed writing about that topic and it got me thinking about how I can start using PureScript right now. This is a bit optimistic, though. Even with the knowledge I now have of creating React components using Pux, I would still say it's a bit of a stretch to think I could pull in PureScript into a project at work, but a man can dream can't he?! ðŸ˜‚

## Getting Started with ReactÂ ðŸš€

To get started create a new React application. You will need webpack, babel, ES2015+, babel-core, babel-loader, and the kitchen sink. No, I will not torture you with creating you own `webpack.config.js`. Instead, to quickly get up and running, use `create-react-app`.

```bash
npm i -g create-react-app # Install it globally
create-react-app ps-and-react # cd into some dir and create a dir
cd ps-and-react && yarn install && yarn start
```

Once you run the commands above you should see a fully functional application running in your browser at `localhost:3000`.

## Finishing it Off with PureScript andÂ Pux

Inside of the `src` directory create a PureScript project scaffold with `pulp`.

```bash
mkdir PureScript
cd PureScript
pulp init
```

Once the project is scaffolded out you will just need to install Pux and React.

```bash
bower install --save purescript-pux purescript-react
```

Create a file called `Counter.purs` and copy pasta this code which basically mimics Pux's example counter tutorial.

```haskell
module Counter where

import Prelude hiding (div)

import Control.Monad.Eff (Eff)
import Pux (CoreEffects, EffModel, start)
import React (ReactClass)
import Pux.DOM.Events (onClick)
import Pux.DOM.HTML (HTML)
import Pux.Renderer.React (renderToReact)
import Text.Smolder.HTML (button, div, span)
import Text.Smolder.Markup (text, (#!))

type State = {
  count :: Int
}

data Event = Increment | Decrement

foldp :: âˆ€ fx. Event -> State -> EffModel State Event fx
foldp Increment state = { state: state { count = state.count + 1 }, effects: [] }
foldp Decrement state = { state: state { count = state.count - 1 }, effects: [] }

view :: State -> HTML Event
view state =
  div do
    button #! onClick (const Increment) $ text "Increment"
    span $ text (show state.count)
    button #! onClick (const Decrement) $ text "Decrement"

toReact :: âˆ€ props fx. State -> Eff (CoreEffects fx) (ReactClass props)
toReact state = do
  app <- start
    { initialState: state
    , view
    , foldp
    , inputs: []
    }

renderToReact app.markup app.input
```

You will notice there is one thing that is different here. Here you have a function `toReact` that returns a `ReactClass` given props. Usually this type of setup is reserved for the `main` function. But in this case you want to export this setup in the function itself.

Make sure to compile before moving to the next step.

```bash
pulp build
```

Now head on over to `App.js` at the root of the React `src` folder and pull in the `Counter` from PureScript.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";

import PSCounter from "./PureScript/output/Counter";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const Counter = PSCounter.toReact({ count: this.props.count })();
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Counter />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Next, pass in the `count` prop to `App` in `index.js`.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<App count={1} />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

When you run `yarn start` again you should see a fully functional React component made with PureScript and Pux!

If you haven't done so already, I recommend looking at the book [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) as well as the [PureScript Documentation](https://github.com/purescript/documentation) to get some more background. Also, check out all the library document on [Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/). If you have any questions check out the [Slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/purescript/purescript) channels. Until next time, keep hacking!
