To summarize, in the last [post](/tutorials/2017-08-14-lets-build-a-simon-game-in-purescript-pt-3) you learned about Pux, the Elm Architecture, and how to integrate the Pux architecture into your application. In this post, you will learn how to add animations to your game that simulate a user click.

## View Layer 🖖

To get started you will need to update the view layer. Currently it demos counter functionality which is not what this series about at all. Put simply, you need 4 divs with the 4 colors of the Simon Game: red, blue, green, and yellow. To create the color styles you will need the CSS library. Let's pull that in to get started.

bower install --save purescript-css

To make things a bit simpler in this process, and for what we are going to do in the future, create a file called `Styles.purs` in the `App` folder. This is where you are going to handle the styles for the `button` components. First pull in the necessary imports.

```haskell
module App.Styles
  ( styledButton
  ) where

import Prelude

import CSS (Color, backgroundColor, height, width)
import CSS.Color (red, green, yellow, blue, black)
import CSS.Size (px)
import Pux.DOM.HTML.Attributes (style)
import Text.Smolder.Markup (Attribute)
```

You will learn more about what these imports do once you start to use them. Create a function `styledButton` that takes a `String` as an argument and returns an `Attribute`.

```haskell
styledButton :: String -> Attribute
styledButton color =
  style do
    backgroundColor bgColor
    height $ px 200.0
    width $ px 200.0
    where bgColor = convertColor color
```

The styles are provided in a `do` block so that you can write multiple styles for a given element. You might notice there are a few things going on here that differ from regular ole' CSS. The `px` acts as a function and takes a `Number`. Also, `backgroundColor` takes a value `bgColor` and in the `where` block that is where `bgColor` is defined. The function `convertColor` is not defined but if you look at the type definition for [backgroundColor](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-css/3.1.0/docs/CSS.Background#v:backgroundColor) you will see that it expects a type of `Color`. That means I can't just pass `"red"` because it is of type `String`, not of type `Color`. Therefore, I created a simple helper function to do this for you.

```haskell
convertColor :: String -> Color
convertColor color =
  case color of
    "red" -> red
    "green" -> green
    "yellow" -> yellow
    "blue" -> blue
    _ -> black
```

Pretty simple, right? Just give this `convertColor` a color of type `String` and you get the color of type `Color` back. That's a lot of coloring 🖍. To make sure you account for all possible arguments, if you don't get a color of the Simon Game, you simple pass back `black`.

With this in your arsenal you can make changes to the view. Create a few divs passing in the `styledButton` function and giving the div a color. To start let's pull in the necessary imports.

```haskell
import App.Styles (styledButton)
import Text.Smolder.Markup (text, (#!), (!)) -- added (!)
```

Now update the `view` function:

```haskell
view :: State -> HTML Event
view state =
  div do
    div ! styledButton "red" $ text ""
    div ! styledButton "green" $ text ""
    div ! styledButton "blue" $ text ""
    div ! styledButton "yellow" $ text ""
```

Because `styledButton` is an `Attribute` you have to prepend it with a `!`. Also, I am probably doing this wrong, but I couldn't find an easy way to create a `div` without appending `$ text ""` at the end for it to compile correctly. If you have an alternate solution, please share in the comments below!

For kicks and giggles run `pulp server` and you should see a bunch of different color divs in your browser 🎉.

You now want to work on simulating a user click. What that entails is when click on a button the button will make a sound and the color of the button will darken. I will just focus on the later part of that in this post, with the former being covered later on. To start, let's name this type of `Event` in the `Events.purs` file while gutting all previous logic that was in there. You can call this event `UserClick` or anything else that makes sense to you.

```haskell
data Event = UserClick String
```

The `tag` `UserClick` will take a string as a value, which will be the color of the button that is clicked. Let's now add this to the `view` function.

```haskell
div ! styledButton "red" #! onClick (const $ UserClick "red") $ text ""
```

This will be implemented for each button in the view.

Now you can update the `foldp` function to handle this `Event` and gut whatever logic was there before while you're at it.

```haskell
foldp :: Event -> State -> EffModel State Event AppEffects
foldp (UserClick color) state =
  { state: state
  , effects: []
  }
```

So let's walk through how this will actually work. The way in which I implemented this before was in two steps. First, update the state with the value of the button that the user clicked as being the `currentColor`. Then, with the help of an `effect`, `delay` a computation for 300 milliseconds and then after that time is up, update the state back to `currentColor: ""`. There is quite a bit going on here so let's first modify the new state record, then handle the update in the `foldp` function.

```haskell
type State =
  { currentColor :: String
  }
```

Because you will need this later, create an `init` function that is the initialState of the application, export it in the module above, import it into `Main.purs` and add it as the `initialState` in the `Pux` setup.

```haskell
init :: State
init =
  { currentColor: ""
  }
```

Now the `foldp` state will be updated when a button is clicked like so.

```haskell
foldp (UserClick color) state =
  { state: state { currentColor = color }
  , effects: []
  }
```

The `state { currentColor = color }` is the record update syntax for creating a new record with all the fields returned with the new updated field value.

Now based on the state you can change the value of the color of the button. Let's update the view to pass in the `currentColor` to div elements.

```haskell
div ! styledButton "red" currenColor #! onClick (const $ UserClick "red") $ text ""

-- Note, make sure this is on 1 line
```

To do this I am destucturing the `state` value passed to the `view` function.

```haskell
view { currentColor } =
  --- more stuff here
```

This is not going to work quite yet. That's because you need to update the `styledButton` function to take another argument. That argument will determine the color of the button. It will look a little something like this:

```haskell
-- Added desaturate
import CSS.Color (red, green, yellow, blue, black, desaturate)

styledButton :: String -> String -> Attribute
styledButton color currentColor =
  let
    converted = convertColor color
    bgColor =
      if currentColor == color then desaturate 0.5 converted
      else converted
  in
   style do
      backgroundColor bgColor
      height $ px 200.0
      width $ px 200.0
```

Let's run a build and see what this does. Run `pulp server` and interact with your buttons.

Nothing too crazy going on here. However, what you need it to do is actually change color and then have that color change back after about 300 milliseconds or so. Let's implement that.

In Elm this is implemented as a side-effect from the result of a `Cmd msg`. In Pux this is handled as just an effect. In my previous implementation in Elm I used the [elm-delay](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/andrewMacmurray/elm-delay/latest) library, so when I shifted to PureScript and Pux I looked for a similar tool and found the [delay](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-aff/3.1.0/docs/Control.Monad.Aff#v:delay) function. This is what you will use to create the animation.

First, add another `Event` that declares a reset of the color in your `Events.purs` file.

```haskell
data Event = UserClick String | ResetColor
```

Then add another pattern in your `foldp` function to match this action.

```haskell
foldp ResetColor state = noEffects state { currentColor = "" }
```

Pux has a nice helper function [noEffects](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-pux/11.0.0/docs/Pux#v:noEffects) that is short-hand for:

```haskell
foldp ResetColor state =
  { state: state { currentColor = "" }
  , effects: []
  }
```

The `delay` function takes a `Milliseconds` type. So let's pull in a library that provides that type and import it.

```bash
bower install --save purescript-datetime
```

```haskell
import Data.Time.Duration (Milliseconds)
import Control.Monad.Aff (delay) -- both in Updated.purs
```

Then inside of the `UserClick` event you can update the effects to first `delay` 300 milliseconds and then execute the `ResetColor` event.

```haskell
foldp (UserClick color) state =
  { state: state { currentColor = color }
  , effects:
    [ delay (Milliseconds 300.0) $> Just ResetColor ]
  }
```

Another operator! The `$>` is known as [voidLeft](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/3.1.0/docs/Data.Functor#v:%28%3C$%29). It says, hey, this computation to the left of me, just ignore that and return what is to the right. To the right you have `Just ResetColor` which is the correct return type of `Maybe Event`. Cool, huh?

Let's run over to the browser and see what you get. Run `pulp server` and see what the output is.

Great, it works as expected!
