_I didn't want to write this post, but I think it's time to share my thoughts. Do your own research on things I have said. Don't take my word for it. If you are interested, learn more about this yourself by posing questions to those involved. You can find them in the Natives in Tech Slack_

I helped to [start Natives in Tech (NiT) back in 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20230115055753/https://forum.nativesintech.org/t/why-we-started-natives-in-tech/28) with other Native technologists. It started out as a Slack workspace and then grew to become a nonprofit in 2019, doing nonprofit stuff like having monthly meetings and raising money, though I regret now it became a nonprofit, which I'll explain. This allowed NiT to build up its infrastructure using resources like Google Workspaces, Netlify, and other services that either supported nonprofits or open source projects. Though this gave us the tools to operate like a nonprofit, I realize with hindsight that NiT was never intended to be a nonprofit. NiT was intended to be a coalition of Native technologists *building* software for Native communities. It wasn't about raising money or _being_ a nonprofit.

_But Adam, you did build technology!_

Yes, that is correct; we did build some things. You can find most of those things [here](https://github.com/nativesintech). I am proud of the things that we helped build with a few other technologists like [Nick Sahler](https://nick.sahler.co/) and others (sorry if I didn't mention you by name here). We even called out ASF on their [digital appropriation of Native identity](https://web.archive.org/web/20230115050946/https://blog.nativesintech.org/apache-appropriation/). But my enthusiasm for the technology faded when it became more about the nonprofit than about building, communicating, and ideating. Those on the board that were technical slowly left. Technical people did not replace them. At the time, I thought I was doing something right by getting people involved that had shown commitment to the community. I think, to some extent, it was the right intention. But it took me further away from what I wanted NiT to be, without knowing it.

_But Adam, there is the NiT conference that showcases Native tech!_

That is true, and I am glad it has taken off as well as it has. But that is something that happens once a year. Hardly the pace at which discussions, ideation, and dialogue need to be had. Unfortunately, despite my intentions, I was not successful in convincing other folks that supporting NiT was important, in terms of the work we were trying to do not related to the conference. We applied for [MIT Solve](https://solve.mit.edu/solutions/36767) but were not awarded a grant. This might have given us more attention and publicity to get Native folks involved that understand our vision and want to be a part of it. That was the hope, at least. But alas, our work went unrecognized.

If NiT has become not what I intended, what is it now? It has become a nonprofit. If you've ever worked for or with a nonprofit at all in your career, then you might know what that comes with. I won't enumerate all the issues nonprofits have, but let's just say that NiT is no different. This is not the fault of those on the board. Nonprofits struggle in all kinds of ways, one of them being able to find good volunteers. If you can't find good volunteers, good board members (also volunteers), then it doesn't get any better. Let's not even get started on hiring. But just to say one thing, let's just say nonprofits have difficulty finding and retaining talent. So imagine you are working for a nonprofit that can't find good volunteers and, even when they are funded, can't find or retain talented workers. Does that sound like a recipe for success?

_But Adam, look how much money NiT has!_

At the time of writing, NiT has about $180,000, which you can see from its [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/natives-in-tech). But money can be just as much a negative as it is a positive. Take, for example, AISES (American Indian Science and Engineering Society), who is supported by [Chevron and Marathon](https://aises.org/partner-with-aises/). AISES is the preeminent leader in STEM programming for Native youth, and yet it's willing to accept funding from Big Oil. How can we imagine a sustainable future for our communities if our communities accept support from companies threatening our existence? Our resilience is our strength, and our strength gives us what we need to exist and thrive. Of course, money helps, but you don't need huge amounts of funding to do incredible work. Just look at the open source community for examples, but I'll give you [one to start](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/discussions/10877#discussioncomment-11414879).

_But Adam, that's just a dream to think you can exist without funding!_

Maybe it is, but to me, NiT was more an idea than anything else. The idea being this: Native people can benefit a lot from open source technology, especially if those building it are Native too, because they have a way better idea about the constraints and trade-offs (this is incredibly important in the age of LLMs), and it's this Native-centric mindset that is needed to build technology in the spirit and desires of our community, which will ultimately serve us better than what currently exists. That is a grand idea but one worth pursuing, an idea that motivated me, and I hope others. If it is an idea that is worthy of your time, energy, and motivation, then I'd like to know who you are. Maybe we can build a coalition, one connection at a time.

_But Adam, this is too big of a goal!_

Yes, it is a huge goal, but there is an implicit context I am skipping over that makes this goal much harder. Native folks have similar histories, but not a shared identity. One _could_ make an argument for Urban Natives coming together in a shared identity for growing up in a city regardless of tribal background, but that is for Urban Natives, not those that grew up in and around their communities. There are yearly conferences that do bring together different Native peoples, but personally, I haven't seen connections made there last beyond or exist outside the conference. The social communities we come from take us back there afterwards. This is not the fault of anyone. Of course, our communities should be the priority. I am just saying our connections are weak, but we can strengthen them. What that will take, I am not sure; all I can do is my best to connect with folks here in Oklahoma, then grow that further and further out.


_But Adam, if not NiT then what?!_

The _what_ is you. The _what_ is your mind, spirit, and body, working in harmony to build tech representative of your community. I'll do my best to do my part. How about you?
