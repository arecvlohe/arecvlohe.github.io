            <h2>üåé Origins</h2>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in St. Petersburg, FL. In my neighborhood, I
              spent time going to my friends' houses and playing football and
              other sports in the street. Growing up, I always knew I was Native
              but I didn't learn or know anything about it. After I graduated
              High School I went to college at the University of Florida. It was
              there I decided to try to reconnect. I started going out to
              Oklahoma during the summers when I wasn't in classes. I met
              relatives on my Yuchi side and made friends with those on my
              Mvskoke side. I began participating in ceremony. After college, I
              moved to Oklahoma and went through several jobs: Yuchi Language
              Instructor, Mvskoke Food Soveriengty Community Outreach
              Coordinator, Glenpool High School Mvskoke Studies Teacher, Yuchi
              Tribe of Indians Admin Assistant. Things weren't working out and I
              was trying to figure myself out too. I moved back to St.
              Petersburg, FL and got a few more jobs in education. I wasn't
              happy with my prospects. I started to learn technology through
              FreeCodeCamp. In a few months I had a job. I knew around that time
              I wanted to move back to Oklahoma, just needed to find a remote
              job. I found one and my way back to Oklahoma where I currently
              reside in Tulsa.
